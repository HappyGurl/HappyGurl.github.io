									<h1>Professional<br />
										Self-Assessment</h1>
									<p>This professional self-assessment highlights my journey through the computer science program, showcasing my strengths, professional goals, and readiness for the tech industry.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in showcasing my strengths, shaping my professional goals and values, and enhancing my employability in the computer science field.</p>
								<p>In my CS-330 project, I focused on optimizing the layout of the DrawMesh and RenderScene functions to enhance the efficiency of data structures and improve code readability. By restructuring these functions, I made the codebase more modular, enabling easier team collaboration and shared contributions. This process sharpened my technical skills and reinforced the value of clear communication with stakeholders, as regular updates and feedback were crucial in refining the approach and ensuring alignment with project goals.</p>
								<p>In CS-340, I explored data structures and algorithms by implementing machine learning techniques to classify rescue animals. This project deepened my understanding of algorithmic efficiency and its real-world applications, reinforcing my goal of using technology to create meaningful solutions. Additionally, my work on database design and security principles throughout the program has prepared me to address the complexities of data management in professional settings.</p>
								<p>In CS-370, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning, which allowed me to apply software engineering principles in designing a robust and scalable solution. This project underscored the importance of building secure systems and understanding the ethical implications of AI, aligning with my values of responsible tech development.</p>
								<P>Together, these artifacts demonstrate my comprehensive skill set, including teamwork, effective communication, and a strong foundation in software engineering and data management. They inform my ePortfolio as a cohesive narrative of my journey in computer science, showcasing my ability to tackle complex challenges and my commitment to ongoing learning and innovation.</P>
